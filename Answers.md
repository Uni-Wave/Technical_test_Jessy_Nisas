This is better than the latest version because the LTS version is a durable version, certified by unity concerning the maintenance and a potential future bugs. (LTS = long term support)
This version is stable with many bugs already fixed.

Magic folders in Unity3D are a folders that can be used with the unity command to access to an asset. (example : Ressource.*.png)

To structure the Assets folder, I create these folders : Mesh3D, Plugins, Prefabs, Scripts, Textures, UI (or UI in Textures), Videos.

I recommend the ITween plugin for create a simple and cool animations with curves. This plugin it's optimized for mobile game and can also be used in the UI.
